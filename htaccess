# To allow the user to choose their language we only match on visits to the root
# page of the site and we permanently re-direct them to the first language
# matching the HTTP Accept-Language header. Since the Accept-Language header is
# typically a list, we match using "^" to only match the first one. This also
# gets us language fallback (i.e. we don't have a de-CH version but de will
# match so the user gets the de site).
#
# New languages must be listed here for redirects to work. More specific locales
# must come before general ones (i.e. de-DE before de).

# RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Language} ^de-DE [NC]
# RewriteRule ^$ /de-DE/ [R=301,L,NC]

# RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Language} ^de [NC]
# RewriteRule ^$ /de/ [R=301,L,NC]

# If the request ends in '.php' strip it and re-direct. This re-directs any URLs
# on the web to the old website to the permanent new locations.
