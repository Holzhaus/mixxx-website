OK everyone.

The submissions for the T-shirt contest are below.
Unfortunately, it seems most of you are much more interested in buying a shirt rather than designing one, so we have only two entries, only one of which is an original design.
That said, it's great design, and so we'd like to congratulate **Joe Colosimo** for his winning entry!

Because one of our developers is going get some stock and handle t-shirt orders for us, we'd still like to know if just a plain Mixxx logo would be a more popular choice.
So please take a look at the designs below and cast your vote!

Voting is open until **January 10th** .

Without further ado, the entries. (Click on each for a larger version.)
