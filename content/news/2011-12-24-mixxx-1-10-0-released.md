Mixxx 1.10.0 brings **several hard-hitting features** that are the culmination of a year's worth of work by the development team.

What we're packing in Mixxx 1.10.0:

- **Rewritten and Improved Vinyl Control Support**
  - Completely rewritten vinyl-style pitch-bending for clean,
    analog-like sound.
  - Absolute, relative, and constant vinyl modes.
  - Rock-solid support for Serato Vinyl/CD or Traktor Vinyl at 33 or 45
    RPM.
  - Single-deck Vinyl Control
  - End-of-record Mode
  - Improved needle skip prevention. 
  - Can use different vinyl types on each deck!
  - Improved audio quality when scratching.
  - Support for **track selection**  using the lead-in area of the vinyl
    and **needle-drop hotcues** .
  - Track lead-in for scratching before the start of songs.
  - Waveform smoothing to prevent wobbly waveforms.
  - New built-in vinyl signal analyzer.
- **4 Sampler Decks**
- **Beatloops, ** **Loop Halve/Double Buttons**
  - Handy beatloop buttons let you quickly throw down an 8-beat loop as
    you transition from one song to the next.
- **Quantized Loops, Hotcues and Beatloops**
  - Turn on quantization mode for a deck and all of your loops, hotcues,
    and beatloops will snap to the nearest beat when you place them.
- **Phase Synchronization**
  - Sync button now synchronizes both the BPM and phase of beats.
- **Beatgrid Adjust Feature**
  - Is your beatgrid misaligned? Easily adjust it with one click.
- **Microphone Support**
  - Streaming and club DJs alike will love this feature. Plug in your
    microphone and MC your show, all without the need for an external
    mixer. 
- **Spinning Turntable Widgets and Waveform Scratching**
  - Skins now come with juicy spinning turntables that you can scratch
    to your heart's delight.
  - If vinyl control is enabled, vinyl signal quality can also be
    rendered to the spinning widgets.
  - Waveform overviews now act as a progress bar for track analysis.
- **M4A Support for Windows Vista and Windows 7 users.**
  - Mixxx previously could not support M4A on Windows due to licensing issues,
    but that restriction is now lifted with our new Windows Media Foundation
    M4A plugin. Mixxx on Mac OS X already supports M4A.
