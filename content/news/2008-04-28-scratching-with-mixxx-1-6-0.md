This latest video of [Mixxx](http://www.mixxx.org) 1.6.0 in action
demonstrates what scratching sounds like with vinyl control. In the
video, I'm scratching with a Serato record on my Stanton T.80
turntable, and using my M-Audio X-Session Pro MIDI controller as a
virtual mixer. I changed Mixxx's crossfader curve setting in the
preferences to "fast cut", which is what you'd set the curve control
on a real mixer to when you're scratching.

The turntable is plugged directly into my laptop using the turntable's
line-out and my laptop's onboard soundcard.

I recently did some work on our "vinyl emulation" code that mimics the
way the pitch changes when you're using a turntable. I managed to
improve the sound quality enough that scratching with Mixxx + vinyl
control sounds convincingly similar to scratching with real vinyl. These
improvements will be included with our next beta release.
