Our website is now based on the [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) instead of the [Cactus](https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus) static site generator.
It supports blog posts natively and also supports pagination, archives, author pages and taxonomies likes categories and tags.
If you want to browse older news articles, using Pelican will make our website more easy to use.

This also means that contributors that want to improve our website don't need a Python 2.7 installation anymore
(Python 2 has reached end-of-life since the beginning of the year).

There are already [some ideas to modernize the look of our website](https://mixxx.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/248802-website/topic/Mixxx.20website.20refresh), and with Pelican we'll have a more solid basis for that.
