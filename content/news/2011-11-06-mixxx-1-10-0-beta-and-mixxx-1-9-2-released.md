What we're packing in Mixxx 1.10.0 Beta:

  - Completely rewritten vinyl-style pitch-bending for clean,
  - analog-like sound.

  - Improved needle skip prevention. 
  - Can use different vinyl types on each deck!
  - Improved audio quality when scratching.
  - Support for **track selection** using the lead-in area of the vinyl
  - and **needle-drop hotcues** .
  - Track lead-in for scratching before the start of songs.
  - Waveform smoothing to prevent wobbly waveforms.
  - New built-in vinyl signal analyzer.
- **4 Sampler Decks**
- **Beatloops, ** **Loop Halve/Double Buttons**
  - Handy beatloop buttons let you quickly throw down an 8-beat loop as
    you transition from one song to the next.

    and beatloops will snap to the nearest beat when you place them.

  - Is your beatgrid misaligned? Easily adjust it with one click.
