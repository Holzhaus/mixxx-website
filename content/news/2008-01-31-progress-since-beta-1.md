Since the release of Mixxx 1.6.0 beta1, we've been busy busy busy getting new features and bug fixes ready for beta2.
The library has undergone substantial work including new playlist support, improvements to the file scanning, and several bug fixes that were causing stability issues in beta1.

Recently, **Micah Lee** (one of our Google Summer of Code students), began working on our BPM code again.
Among his latest additions is support for "BPM schemes", which allows you to save preset BPM ranges to improve the accuracy of the BPM detection when launched from the track editor dialog.

*"BPM Schemes" is one of the new features slipped into Mixxx 1.6.0
Beta2*

Also, **OS X users** can expect a Leopard/Intel package for Beta2.
Big thanks to all the testers who've helped me test the package.

Lastly, we expect the 1.6.0 beta2 release sometime in the next two weeks.
There's still a few extra features we're going to try to slip in to the next release, so stay tuned!
