Mixxx has always been driven by constant feedback from our community of DJs.
Two years ago, you helped steer the development of Mixxx by giving us feedback through a user survey that we created.
Consequently, we focused our efforts for the last two releases on the features you asked for the most, and it's time to get another round of feedback to find out how we've done, and where you'd like to see Mixxx go.

So if you have a few minutes, please fill out [the Mixxx 2009 User Survey](https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/mixxx.org/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dE1WUzViMmRGOW40NHh1Wkd1dWRtc0E6MA..)!

We read every response and appreciate your feedback.
Filling out the survey is a fast and easy way to make a contribution to Mixxx, and your responses will make a big impact on future releases.
Thanks!
