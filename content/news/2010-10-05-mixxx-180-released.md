*"Deere" skin, new in Mixxx 1.8.0*

**Mixxx 1.8.0 is now available on our [downloads page]({filename}/pages/download.md).**

This new release includes a year's worth of contributions from over 30 developers and artists, and is our most exciting release to date.
Mixxx 1.8.0 includes much anticipated features such as looping, hot cues, support for multiple MIDI devices, and a brand new database-powered library.

Since Mixxx 1.7.2 was released, the following changes have been made:

  - iTunes library and playlists access (Windows and Mac OS X)
  - Rhythmbox library and playlists access (Linux)

**Ubuntu Users**

We have great news for Ubuntu users: Mixxx 1.8.0 is available in **Ubuntu 10.10**  (Maverick Meerkat) directly from the Ubuntu Software Center!
We also have a PPA containing Mixxx 1.8.0 for Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid) users, accessible from our [downloads page]({filename}/pages/download.md).

**Audio Playback Plugins**

We've also added an **audio playback plugin architecture** to Mixxx, which allows Mixxx to playback extra formats with third-party plugins.
Since audio formats like M4A/AAC are encumbered by software patents which restrict distribution and usage in certain jurisdictions, Mixxx cannot natively support them.
However, the good news is that a licensed third-party can now develop and distribute an M4A plugin for Mixxx.
We'll be posting some of our own audio plugins to the [Mixxx Add-ons](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/add-ons) wiki page in the coming weeks, so be sure to check back again soon.

**Fundraiser**

We realized in the course of packaging 1.8.0 (by hand) that since we're planning on [speeding up our release cycles](%7Bfilename%7D/news/2010-06-27-turning-mixxx-blog-into-blog.md), now might time to purchase a **dedicated build server** that will allow us to create nightly builds and automate our releases.
Money raised will go to cover the cost of the server, and any leftover money will cover other ongoing expenses like web hosting, and otherwise help [keep Mixxx rocking](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/13624)!

We depend on feedback from our users to guide Mixxx's development, so let us know what you think of the new release!
