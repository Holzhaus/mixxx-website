**Mixxx** was spotted last Sunday at the [Cheap as Chips](http://www.christchurchmusic.org.nz/content/festivals-4) music festival in Christchurch, New Zealand. [DJ Kid 90](http://www.myspace.com/kid90nz) dropped "a set of lush kiwi tunes to 10,000ish people", and was looking quite slick with his MacBook.

Kid 90 hosts an independent New Zealand electronica show on [RDU](http://www.rdu.org.nz) , one of NZ's student radio stations. The show runs from 5 - 7pm Saturdays (NZ time), and he says he tends to play "Downbeat, Breaks and D'n'B with a little Psy thrown in for good measure".
