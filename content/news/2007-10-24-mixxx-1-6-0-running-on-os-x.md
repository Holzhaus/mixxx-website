I picked up a Macbook a few days ago after weeks of trying to find a decent laptop.
This is good news for Mixxx because it means our OS X maintainer (*cough* me) now has a Mac at home. :)

Since the last time I compiled Mixxx on OS X, we've done a tremendous amount of work to port the project to Qt4.
Because of all the changes, I needed to give our SCONS build files an update in order to make Mixxx 1.6.0 build properly on OS X.
After a few hours of tweaking away, I got it compiling, linking, **and** running (don't take that for granted):

In the long run, hopefully we'll be able to better tackle OS X-only bugs.
Despite this screenshot, we're still a ways off from the 1.6.0 beta release.
We've got a fair number of bugs to fix in the meantime before anything is releasable.
