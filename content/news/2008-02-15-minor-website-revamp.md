[![Mixxx Logo]({static}/images/news/logo-mixxx.png)]({static}/images/news/logo-mixxx.png)

If anyone reads our developer's mailing list, you might know I'm not a huge fan of SourceForge.
We've been planning for months to move away from it, and today we've taken a big step in that direction.
Our website is now located at: **[www.mixxx.org]({filename}/pages/index.md)**

We've also started using our new logo, created by [Paul Bloch of OpenArtist](http://openartist.net/).
He's quite talented, and is working on a more thorough overhaul of the Mixxx website to be launched sometime in the upcoming months.

Among the new changes to the website are our [new forums](http://www.mixxx.org/forums), and our new (and faster) [Mixxx
Wiki](http://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki).
We're looking forward to helping the community grow on the new forums.

Lastly, we're going to be using our Launchpad page's [bug tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/) from now on.
It's much easier to use, and isn't cluttered with 10 megabytes worth of flash ads like the old one. :)

Enjoy!
