Sean Pappalardo's been busy again, this time working on support for the
Stanton SCS.1m and improving our existing support for the SCS.3d. In
this first video, Sean explains some of the neat features he's coded
like fader-start, real-time feedback using the SCS.1m LED digit
displays, and lots of other bells and whistles.

In this second video, Sean demonstrates some of the new features he's
implemented since he made his [original SCS.3d
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfkJnTqIeAw), including the new
vinyl platter mode and VU meters.

Our improved SCS.3d and SCS.1m support will be available for everyone to
play with in our next beta. In the meantime, current hardware owners can
still use their controllers with [Mixxx 1.7.0
Beta1]({filename}/pages/download.md) , but they'll have some
extra to look forward to in our next release.

Speaking of which - Since our recent beta, your bug reports have
provided us with important feedback that's helped us discover, fix, and
prevent several problems. We've now identified a handful of remaining
issues that we want to tackle, and once they're fixed, we'll either
release another beta or a "release candidate". We've also completed a
preliminary round of planning for Mixxx 1.8, but we'll save that for
another blog post. Stay tuned!
