**Google** has [just announced](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2012/03/mentoring-organizations-for-google.html)  the participating mentoring organizations for [Google Summer of Code 2012](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012)  and **[Mixxx has been accepted](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/mixxx)** into the program!

Google Summer of Code is a global program that allows students to receive a $5000 USD stipend for writing code for an open source software project over the summer.
Students can apply by submitting an application to a mentoring organization (like us) via the [GSoC 2012](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012) website.
For more information about how GSoC works, please see the [program FAQ](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs).

To get prospective students started, we've put up a list of [GSoC 2012 Project Ideas for Mixxx](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/gsoc2012ideas) on our wiki, but we're always interested in new ideas.
We also recommend taking a peek at our page of [general advice for students](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/gsocadvice) interested in applying.
**The application period for students begins on March 26th and ends April 6th at 19:00 UTC.**

Our past summer projects have included rewriting our scrolling waveform widgets, adding Shoutcast broadcasting support to Mixxx, and improving our audio mixer routing code.
A full list of our past GSoC projects is available on the [front page](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki#google_summer_of_code) of our wiki.

Interested? [Apply starting March 26th](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/mixxx) and come hack on the best free MP3 DJ mixing software for the Summer!
