The Mixxx development team suggests 1.6.0 is most delicious if you [get it while it's hot.](http://mixxx.sourceforge.net/download.php)

This is the first beta release of the 1.6.0 series and incorporates an
enormous number of new toys, some of the highlights are:

-   [Vinyl control](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2ZPSSXlK60)
-   Skin colour schemes
-   New music library
-   Better BPM detection
-   Better support for MIDI controllers
-   [... and more](http://mixxx.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Roadmap#Changelog)

Obviously as with all beta software, expect a few problems, the following are things you may encounter:

-   Various library issues, especially with regard to colour schemes and scanning/persistency
-   Ubuntu users may have trouble connecting to JACK, we are working hard on this
-   Vinyl control is not very extensively tested so please report your experiences

We desperately need your feedback to make 1.6.0 better, please report problems in any of the usual places, such as the [bug tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=47577&atid=449891) or on mixxx-devel for those who are subscribed.

We'd also like to mention that we're [accepting donations](http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=47577) to help support Mixxx's development.
If you enjoy the software, use it professionally, or would just like to help us out, we'd appreciate a [donation](http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=47577) of any size.

Finally, we'd like to say thanks to all the people that make this possible, the Mixxx developer team, all our users, PortAudio and all our other friends and colleagues.
