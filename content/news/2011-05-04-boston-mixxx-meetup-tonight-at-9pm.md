Calling all Boston-area Mixxxers -- tonight we're hosting an impromptu Mixxx user meetup care of the Redhat conference that's in town this week.

Join us at the World Trade Center at 9pm tonight to hang out with other Mixxx users and developers.
We'll have a bunch of gear to play with and we'll be showing off some of the latest features in the upcoming Mixxx 1.10 release.
Come check it out!
