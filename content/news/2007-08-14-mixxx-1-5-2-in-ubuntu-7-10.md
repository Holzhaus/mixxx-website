Ubuntu 7.10's universe repository now contains a pre-release of Mixxx 1.5.2.
This new version fixes several crashes, and should be more stable than 1.5.0.
The 1.5.2 binaries for other platforms should follow sometime in the next few weeks (unless we decide to just release a beta of 1.6.0... depends on how things go).
