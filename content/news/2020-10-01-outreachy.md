### Realizing a More Diverse Community.

Mixxx is proud to announce that we have been officially accepted into the Outreachy program and are immediately [raising funds](https://opencollective.com/mixxx) to sponsor our first Intern for the December 2020 cycle!
We first announced our intention to join with Outreachy back in [June](../2020-06-29-black-lives-matter), and we're excited that our plan is coming to fruition.

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) provides three-month internships to work in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
Outreachy internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration and graphical design, or data science.
Interns often find employment after their internship with Outreachy sponsors or in jobs that use the skills they learned during their internship.

Outreachy expressly invites women (both cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people to apply.
We also expressly invite applications from residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, Native American/American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.
Anyone who faces under-representation, systematic bias, or discrimination in the technology industry of their country is invited to apply.

More details and eligibility criteria can be found on the [Outreachy website](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/)

[**Applications are open!**](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/)

### Internship Funding

Because Mixxx is an all-volunteer community, we don't yet have the funds we need to sponsor our first intern.

That's where you come in!

Our users have told us they want to give back, even though Mixxx is and always will be free.
This is your chance to show your love for Mixxx.
We've set up a fundraiser on OpenCollective so you can help Mixxx expand its contributor base and become a more vibrant, sustainable project.
You can make a one-time donation, or you can set up a monthly contribution too.
Our first goal is to sponsor our new Intern, and if we raise more than we need, we'll try to sponsor more than one.

Even though Mixxx is free, please be aware that collecting money isn't.
Between payment processing fees and fundraiser hosting fees, the amount collected by Mixxx won't be as much as you pledged.
If you're able to add a few dollars to help defray those costs, we'd greatly appreciate it.

We have two ways to give: [OpenCollective]("https://opencollective.com/mixxx/contribute") is set up to receive donations in dollars, and we also have a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/mixxx-dj-software-outreachy-internship) to receive donations in Euros.
Please use whichever you wish!

#### OpenCollective
For now, the most efficient way to donate from the U.S. is with a direct bank transfer through OpenCollective.
If you're not comfortable giving your bank account information, you can use credit cards or paypal.
With PayPal and credit card processing, extra fees are charged from the donated money.
You can click on your donation to see how the exact fees were calculated, but generally there will be 10% deducted to pay for our fundraiser host and bank handling.
PayPal may add a 5% fee on top of the donated amount if currency conversion is required.
We have vetted these organizations and they are providing a great service to open source projects like ours, so we are confident that this portion of the money is going to a good place.
We are working with OpenCollective on reducing these overhead costs for future fundraisers.

#### GoFundMe

GoFundMe's fees are optional, so it may be a better option for those who want to donate with Euros.
This GoFundMe will only exist for the duration of this fundraiser, whereas OpenCollective will be a persistent platform for giving to Mixxx, and supports recurring donations.
